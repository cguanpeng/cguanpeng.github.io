                    <p>The prototype of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2775160/">Noah's Dilemma</a> was made back in 2021, right after I wrapped up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761350/">my previous game</a>. I wanted to create something less narrative-focused, and in my search for the core gameplay, I discovered that Sudoku was a lesser-explored genre when it came to premium games. So I built a prototype with an adapted Sudoku ruleset and managed to fit it into a Noah’s Ark-themed world.
<br><br>
However, the prototype didn’t turn out as fun as I had hoped, so I shelved it—just like many other fruitless prototypes I made during that time. But unlike most of the ideas I dropped and never revisited, this one somehow stuck with me.
<br><br>
That’s why, when I finally decided to quit my job and become a full-time indie game developer in November 2023, I reopened the project and gave it another shot. My hunch was right—after some iterations and crucial design changes, the prototype became interesting enough that I decided to turn it into my second commercial game.
<br><br>
This time, I also learned to compose music for it, making this my first fully solo project. It’s also my first roguelike, and I chose the genre not just because of its popularity, but because I’ve always ranked “roguelike deckbuilders” at the top of my personal fun tier list.
<br><br>
When I quit my job, I knew I had two possible directions for my first attempt at professional gamedev (which might be my only shot, given my savings):
<br><br>1. Make the most fun game I can make.<br>2. Make the most personal game I can make.<br><br>
I chose the former because my last game leaned toward the latter, and more importantly, I need to experiment with more popular genres to help me reach a wider audience (to earn enough to survive).
<br><br>
For a long time, I doubted that decision—until recently, when I finally started to see what the game had become. My biggest fear was that by leaning into a popular genre, I’d end up making just another ordinary game. That’s the last thing I want. I’d rather create a risky, weird little game than a forgettable one. So my goal for the past year has always been to bring something new to the table within this highly competitive genre.
<br><br>
Luckily, what I feared didn’t happen. I’m not saying Noah’s Dilemma is already a great addition to the genre (I hope it will be eventually), but I’m relieved that it turned out to be more personal than I expected, despite its genre. I guess that’s just what happens when you make a game alone—like how two people drawing the same thing will still end up with something unique, shaped by their quirks and style. I love playing games that feel personal, and I hope you do too.
<br><br>
So, after working on it full-time for 14 months straight, here’s what I’ve got for you: a Sudoku-inspired, Noah’s Ark roguelike crew-builder, made by one guy.
<br><br>
The game is over 90% complete, and I plan to release it on Steam in the first half of 2025. But right now, I’m already nervous as hell because the game’s demo will be participating in the upcoming February Steam Next Fest. It’ll be the first public demo, and it could reveal a lot about whether the game is on track to do well or not at launch.
<br><br>
Anyway, before this post gets any longer, I’ll wrap it up here. See you all—along with new players—in the fest! Until then, take care, stay tuned, and if you haven’t already, wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2775160/">Noah's Dilemma</a>. Thanks!
