                    <p>It's 2:55 at midnight, Jan 23, 2024. My hands are so cold so I turned on the heater, thinking I'll turn that off in just a minute to save electricity bill.
A heater is too expansive for an indie game developer who just quit his day job.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm pretty tired but I don't want to go to bed just yet. I want to spend every waking minute making this new game because I enjoy the process so much.
Still at the honeymoon phase with it, I guess.</p>
<br>
<p>This new game (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2775160/"><u>Noah's Dilemma</u></a>) has almost no story so I can happily focus on making the gameplay. A lot of programming challenges but they can be solved with logic one by one.
Writing stories on the other hand requires a lot more energy and is much more unpredictable.</p>
<br>
<p>That is why people always advice against putting stories in
games that are supposed to be small in scale. I've done stories in my last game so I know it's true.
I love stories but having no need to think about them just makes a game much easier to make.</p>
<br>
<p>Ok, enough of writing this and I have to go back to finish today's development task.
Heater's off, and I'll pick up from here another time.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>It's midnight again on Jan 27, 2024. Since January is almost over, I can start listing out all the important progress I made this month.</p>
<br>
<p>In chronological order:</p>
<br>
<h2>1. Found out the hard truth about Steamdeck.</h2>
<p>That is you cannot get your game officially verified for Steamdeck unless Steam thinks your game is qualified.
I only knew this because I tried to do controller support for my game Booth.</p>
<br>
<p>Without an official verification, even if the game runs fine on Steamdeck I think it's hardly going to sell more. Also considering the difficulty of adding controller support in GameMaker (even with the help of the great plugin Input), I had to pause this task and shift all my focus back on my new game Noah.</p>
<br>
<h2>2. Prepared for the Steam store page of Noah.</h2>
<p>Getting a steam store page ready requires 3 major things: key art with a game logo, five screenshots, and description (with localization preferably).</p>
<br>
<p>I spent 9 days preparing all that, and some screenshots are just mock-up that needs to be implemented at a later stage. It's better to get your store page up
as soon as possible so that you can start accumulating wishlists at an early stage.</p>
<br>
<h2>3. Built a new personal website.</h2>
<p>Before releasing the steam store page I spent a weekend making my new personal website. If I want to continue my gamedev career as a solo developer
it's better for me to have a dedicated website.</p>
<br>
<p>I had some experience making websites before,
but this time I wanted to try something new and find out the most painless way for me to do it. After a whole day of researching and experimenting,
I settled down with the combination of 11ty and Tailwind. These two are the perfect tools for my need of running a static website with blog posts.</p>
<br>
<h2>4. Released the Steam store page of Noah.</h2>
<p>I picked a Wednesday to release Noah's steam store page to see how many wishlists I can get on the first day.
When releasing a game on steam, we can only pick weekdays, so I wanted to see how it'd perform on a Wednesday.</p>
<br>
<p>The result is, after announcing it everywhere, 33 wishlists on the first day.
My last game Booth had 40 wishlists on the first day, but it had a pretty good trailer. This is the first time I put out a store page without a video.
Anyway, there's no need to get discouraged because it's a long way to go from here. I'll be constantly updating the content of the store page and
let's see how it goes in the next month.</p>
<br>
<h2>5. Great progress on Noah.</h2>
<p>Some developers think it's a bad idea to spend time on art at an early stage, but for me, making sure the game looks good is essential for my
motivation. I also think art plays an important role in the whole experience of Noah. So this month, I drew the sea, the ark, and the animals.</p>
<br>
<p>As for gameplay, some of the most important features have also been implemented, such as choosing which path to travel on sea.</p>
<br>
<h2>6. Started a secret side project.</h2>
<p>I don't know about other developers but I always need a side project for the sake of relaxation.
My ideal side project would be a small game I can work on without thinking too much about reception.</p>
<br>
<p>I had a lot of side projects before but they all failed due to the same reason:
they turned out to be not that small and required a lot more time than I thought.
I've learnt throughout the years that I just can't work on two serious projects at once,
so a side project needs to be truly small in scale and stay that way.</p>
<br>
<p>This new one I came up with has been looking good so far, but I probably felt this way everytime so let's just wait and see.
My hope is to finish this side project within this year and maybe even release it prior to Noah.</p>
<br>
<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that for the entire January, I have been running every Wednesday.
I want to keep doing this and one of my yearly goals is running 2000m without taking a break. Good physical health is also important for indie developers.</p>
<br>
<p>I think that's all for January. There's an indie game contest I took part in, but the result has not come out yet. No matter the result,
the thing I should do remains the same: finishing the game.</p>
